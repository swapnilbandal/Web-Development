it is use to add functionality and behaviour into web app.
it is loosly type language
there are two ways to use javascript

window.alert(): it will generate one popup window.
console.log : it is use q2w3tr for console purpose.

why javascript is called as loosly typed language?
ans=> when we create a variable in javascript we cannot determine what type of data it contains until and unless we initialize it.

what is differancr between let, var and const keyword?


Function:
ut us block of code which is use to perform particular operation.
function will execute only when we call it.
it can be use multiple times.

function functionName(){
    //code
}

function with return value:
anonymous function function without functionName
arrow function: function with no name and noe funcdtion keyword called arrow
()=>{}


//array
it is used to store multiple values with same data type 

//for of to display array data

//convert object data into json;
json.stringify

string it is a collection of characters
in string 

//lastindexOf()

//search
faster than index of methodd
search from left to right

there are three methods which return part of string by passing index number
4. slice(startindex, endindex)
if we write +ve index then it will reach from left to right.
if we write -ve index then it will reach from right to left.

5. Substring(startindex, endindex)
it will return part of string
if we write negative index it wont give any value

settimeout(callfunction,duration)
setInterval(callback,duration)
//it will call another method multiple after particular time interval
2009 ECMA script-5 or ES-5
2015 ECMA script-6 or ES-6

//foeEach: it will call another method once fo;r; eaach array getElementById
courses.forEach((val,index)=>{
    console.log(val)
})
