//oops 
it provide security to our code
code reusability
easy to maintain

//features
1.class:    collection of data member and member function
            blueprint of object and it is a logical entity
            it is a template which we can re-use.
            class name must start with capital letter.

2.object:   it is an instance of class . with thr help of object we can access class data-member and member-function outside class
*constructor:    it is special member function of class.
                it execute automatically when class object is create or initialize
                constructor name should be only constructor
3.inheritance:  
super: it represent parent class constructor inside child class constructor
        it must be first statement in child class constructor
4.encapsulation: wrapping of data into single unit
5.Abstraction: hiding unnecceasaary data and showing only required thing.
        static data member and member function will be accessible onl;y outside class with classname only t o make static data member we use static keyword
6.Polymorphism: its ability to take more than one form

method overloading : when we have multiple method with same name in same class
method overriding : when we have multiple method with same name in different class.

Modules: it contain single or multiple js file which had specific use
        in this if you want to; share data from onr file to another for that er use "export" keyword
        if you want to access data from another file for that we use impoer keyword.
